# CP468 Artificial-Intelligence
Examination of current concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Topics include knowledge representation, automated reasoning, heuristic search, machine learning and knowledge-based systems. Extensive use of case studies and current applications.

## A1
In this part of the assignment, you must write code in Python to 
implement given two search algorithms to solve Travelling salesman problem (TSP) using a list of 
cities (“city_data_50.csv” available under the Assignment 1 section on Myls that include 
“latitude” and “longitude” of each city). You will be in charge of a "Travelling Salesman" agent 
that needs to find the shortest route and distance to visit all the cities. You would have to create 
a module to calculate the distance matrix to find the Euclidian distances between the cities for 
further analysis. Then implement functions for the following search algorithms for solving TSP:  

a) Depth-first search  

b) Breadth-first search
